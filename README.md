# AI/ML engineering experimental space 

## My collection of experimental projects written to explore AI engineering with the focus on natural language processing ( NLP )

In this repo I explore concepts related to AI engineering and NLP with the goal of building core components of AI backed systems.
My goal with the components is to create them in a way that follows OOP application design principles, ready for potential scaling
but at the same time keeping things relatively simple. 
Initial inspiration for projects comes from [ai_engineering_hub](https://github.com/patchy631/ai-engineering-hub). Besides that
I explore topics of computational linguistics, machine learning and robotics. So this collection is primeraly meant for backend systems.

types of systems you can find here:
* optical character recognition ( OCR )
* retrieval augmented generation ( RAG )
* model context protocol tools ( MCP )
* automations with AI
* AI agents

## Installation
Each project has it's own setup and installation guides in a separate readme file. You also can expect some project to be built on top of locally running models.

## Need an AI solution?
Feel free to contact me if you want to develop a custom AI solution or want to adapt one of the projects for your business case
